# User App for 3rd year Uni project.
## Integrating Arduino Serial Output with windows form (.NET framework) [C#]

The aim of the app is to improve the user experience in the acclimation period faced when, for the first time or whenever they feel insecure, using a powered prosthetic finger.

Currently the project is in first release, with basic functionality achieved.
Although still very much in beta with boundless room for improvement.

A build has been published and is avilable for download upon request.
