# User App for 3rd year Uni project.
## Integrating Arduino Serial Output with windows form (.NET framework) [C#]

Currently the project is in first release, with basic functionality achieved.
Although still very much in beta with boundless room for improvement.

The aim of the app is to improve the use experience in the acclimation period faced when, for the first time or whenever they feel insecure, using a powered prosthetic finger.
